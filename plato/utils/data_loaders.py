"""
The implementation of various wrappers to support flexible combinations of data loaders.

Two types of data loader wrappers are supported:

    - ParallelDataLoader
    - SequentialDataLoader

One specific utilization condition is self-supervised learning, where datasets,
such as STL10, contains trainsets with and without labels, and the desired data
loader first loads the trainset with labels and then the one without labels.
We can use SequentialDataLoader for this purpose.
