# Breaching

This is the breaching package. You'll find attack implementations under `breaching.attacks`, use case implementations under `breaching.cases`, metrics under `breaching.analysis` and the configurations for everything under `breaching.config`. Several helper files are implemented under `breaching.utils`.

More details can be found in each module.
