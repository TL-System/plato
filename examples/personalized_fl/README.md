# Approaches for Personalized Federated Learning

Implementations of existing approaches for personalized federated learning using the Plato framework.

--- 
## Baseline Algorithm

We implemented the FedAvg with finetuning, referred to as FedAvg_finetune, as the baseline algorithm for personalized federated learning. The code is available under `fedavg_finetune/`.
