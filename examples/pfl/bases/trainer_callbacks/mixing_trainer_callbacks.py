"""
Customize callbacks for trainer performing mixture optimization of the global model
and personalized models. Typical approaches are APFL, Ditto, LG-FedAvg.

As the global model and personalized models are jointly trained during the normal 
federated training process, the personalized model and its test metrics will be 
saved after the local update.

Therefore,
1. personalized model will be saved and tested during the normal federated learning
process.
2. no personalization model will be optimized during the personalization.
