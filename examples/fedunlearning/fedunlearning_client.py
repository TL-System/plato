"""
A customized client for federated unlearning.

Federated unlearning allows clients to proactively erase their data from a trained model. The model
will be retrained from scratch during the unlearning process.

If the AdaHessian optimizer is used, it will reflect what the following paper proposed:

Liu et al., "The Right to be Forgotten in Federated Learning: An Efficient Realization with Rapid
Retraining," in Proc. INFOCOM, 2022.
