"""
A customized server for federated unlearning.

Federated unlearning allows clients to proactively erase their data from a trained model. The model
will be retrained from scratch during the unlearning process.

If the AdaHessian optimizer is used, it will reflect what the following paper proposed:

Liu et al., "The Right to be Forgotten in Federated Learning: An Efficient Realization with Rapid
Retraining," in Proc. INFOCOM, 2022.

    When 'data_deletion_round' specified in the configuration, the server will enter a retraining
    phase after this round is reached, during which it will roll back to the minimum round number
    necessary for all the clients requesting data deletion.

    For example, if client #1 wishes to delete its data after round #2, the server first finishes
    its aggregation at round #2, then finds out whether or not client #1 was selected in one of the
    previous rounds. If it was, the server will roll back to the round when client #1 was selected
    for the first time, and starts retraining phases from there. Otherwise, it will keep training
    but with client #1 deleting a percentage of its data samples, according to `delete_data_ratio`
