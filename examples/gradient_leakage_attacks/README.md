## Run FL with DLG attack
Run the program using the following cmd under the directory `examples/gradient_leakage_attacks` for example, which launches the csDLG attack using delta matching against an untrained ResNet18 model in `.eval()` mode on CIFAR100 data:
```
python dlg.py -c untrained_eval_delta.yml
```

## DLG Related Configurations
Try tuning the following hyperparameters in `.yml` configuration files.

### under `algorithm`

- `attack_method: [DLG, iDLG, csDLG]` — DLG attack variants

- `cost_fn: [l2, l1, max, sim, simlocal]` — different way to calculate the loss function used in DLG attack variants

- `total_variation: [float]` — weight for adding total data variation to the loss used in DLG attack variants

- `rec_optim: ["Adam", "SGD", "LBFGS"]` — Optimizer used for reconstructing data; DLG uses LBFGS, csDLG uses Adam
  
- `rec_lr: float` — learning rate of the optimizer for data reconstruction

- `lr_decay: [boolean]`, `cost_weights: ["linear", "exp", "equal"]`, `boxed: [boolean]` — hyperparameters for csDLG

- `attack_round: [int]` — which particular communication round to reconstruct data from gradients/weights obtained; 1st round is what literature usually assumes

- `victim_client: [int]` — which particular client to reconstruct data from, e.g., the 1st selected client

- `num_iters: [int]` — the number of iterations for matching gradients/weights

- `log_interval: [int]` — how often the matching loss, performance, etc., are logged

- `target_eval: [boolean]` —  whether or not set model to `.eval()` mode at the client's local training process

- `dummy_eval: [boolean]` —  whether or not set model to `.eval()` mode at the server's dummy data optimization process

- `init_data: ["randn", "rand", "zeros", "half"]` — Dummy data initialization

- `init_params: [boolean]` — whether or not use explicit initialization for model weights

- `share_gradients: [boolean]` — whether sharing gradients or model weights

- `match_weights: [boolean]` — when `share_gradients` is set to `false`, whether reconstructing data by directly matching weights or by matching gradients calculated from model updates.

- `use_updates: [boolean]` — when `share_gradients` is set to `false` and `match_weights` is set to `true`, whether matching weights (absolute) or model updates (delta)

- `trials: [int]` — the number of times the attack will be performed, with different initializations for dummy data

- `random_seed: [int]` — the random seed for generating dummy data and label

- `defense: [no, GC, DP, Soteria, GradDefense, Outpost(ours)]` — different defenses against DLG attacks

- (for GC) `prune_pct: 80` 
- (for DP) `epsilon: 0.1`
- (for Soteria) `threshold: 50`
- (for GradDefense) `clip: true`
- (for GradDefense) `slices_num: 10`
- (for GradDefense) `perturb_slices_num: 5`
- (for GradDefense) `scale: 0.01`
- (for GradDefense) `Q: 6`
- (for Outpost) `beta: 0.125` — iteration decay speed
- (for Outpost) `phi: 40` — the amount (%) of perturbation
- (for Outpost) `prune_base: 80` — pruning percentage
- (for Outpost) `noise_base: 0.8` — scale for gaussian noise

### under `trainer`

- `model_type: vit` — needed when using ViTs as the model; specify the ViT model name such as `vit-base-patch16-224-in21k` to `model_name` at the same time

### under `results`

- `subprocess: [int]` — the name of the subdirectory (subprocess) from which the file should be loaded from. Takes the latest one if not specified

- `trial: [int]` — the trial number to be plotted. Plots the best reconstruction based off MSE if not specified

- `cols/rows: [int]` — specify the number of columns or rows in the plotted figure
