    # whether to maintain the state of the trained personalized

    # In general, for the contrastive self-supervised learning
    # every eval test should be a new learning process to train
    # the randomly initialized personalized model
    # Thus, setting do_maintain_per_state to be false to follow
    # this rule.
    # However, in some cases, we want to maintain the state of the
    # trained personalized model in each round.
    # Then, setting do_maintain_per_state to be True to follow this
    # rule.
    # For the FedRep method, there is no need to hold the state of
    # the personalized model, i.e., do_maintain_per_state: False.
    # The main reasons are that:
    #   1.- based on the FedRep's official code only the head is
    #       trained in the final round for personalization.
    #   2.- as we set the 'global_model_name' to be 'encoder', the
    #       client will complete the downloaded global model based on
    #       client's saved trained global model in the previous round.
    #       This achieves the:  φ^t, h_i^(t-1) mentioned in the paper
    #       Please access func 'load_payload' for details.
    #   3.- we copy the completed global model to the personalized model
    #       in the personalization. Thus, based on the paper, only the head
    #       of the personalized model is optimized to obtain the performance
    #       in each client.
    # Therefore, we do not need to maintain the state of the personalized model
    # to recovery the trained personalized model.
