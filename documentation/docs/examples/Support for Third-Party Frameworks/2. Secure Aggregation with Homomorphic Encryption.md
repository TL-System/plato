### MaskCrypt

MaskCrypt is a secure federated learning system based on homomorphic encryption. Instead of encrypting all the model updates, MaskCrypt encrypts only part of them to balance the tradeoff between security and efficiency. In this example, clients only select 5% of the model updates to encrypt during the learning process. The number of encrypted weights is determined by `encrypt_ratio`, which can be adjusted in the configuration file. A random mask will be adopted if `random_mask` is set to true.
