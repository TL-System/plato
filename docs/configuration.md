# Configuration Settings

In Plato, all configuration settings are read from a configuration file when the clients and the servers launch, and the configuration file follows the YAML format for the sake of simplicity and readability. This document introduces all the possible settings in the configuration file.

```{note}
Attributes in **bold** must be included in a configuration file, while attributes in *italic* only need to be included under certain conditions.
```


## general

```{admonition} base_path
The path prefix for datasets, models, checkpoints, and results.

The default value is `./`.
```


## clients

```{admonition} **type**
The type of the federated learning client. Valid values include `simple`, which represents a basic client who sends weight updates to the server; and `mistnet`, which is client following the MistNet algorithm.
```

```{admonition} **total_clients**
The total number of clients in a training session.
```

```{admonition} **per_round**
The number of clients selected in each round. It should be lower than `total_clients`.
```

````{admonition} do_test
Whether or not the clients compute test accuracies locally using local testsets. Computing test accuracies locally may be useful in certain cases, such as personalized federated learning. Valid values are `true` or `false`.

```{note}
If this setting is `true` and the configuration file has a `results` section, test accuracies of every selected client in each round will be logged in a `.csv` file.
```
````

````{admonition} comm_simulation
Whether client-server communication should be simulated with reading and writing files. This is useful when the clients and the server are launched on the same machine and share a filesystem. 

The default value is `true`.

```{admonition} compute_comm_time
When client-server communication is simulated, whether or not the transmission time — the time it takes for the payload to be completely transmitted to the server — should be computed with a pre-specified server bandwidth.
```
````

`````{admonition} speed_simulation
Whether or not the training speed of the clients are simulated. Simulating the training speed of the clients is useful when simulating *client heterogeneity*, where asynchronous federated learning may outperform synchronous federated learning. Valid values are `true` or `false`.

If `speed_simulation` is `true`, we need to specify the probability distribution used for generating a sleep time (in seconds per epoch) for each client, using the following setting:

```{admonition} random_seed
This random seed is used exclusively for generating the sleep time (in seconds per epoch). 

The default value is `1`.
```

```{admonition} max_sleep_time
This is used to specify the longest possible sleep time in seconds. 

The default value is `60`.
```

````{admonition} simulation_distribution
Parameters for simulating client heterogeneity in training speed. It has an embedded parameter `distribution`, which can be set to `normal` for the normal distribution, `zipf` for the Zipf distribution (which is discrete), or `pareto` for the Pareto distribution (which is continuous).

For the normal distribution, we can specify `mean` for its mean value and `sd` for its standard deviation; for the Zipf distribution, we can specify `s`; and for the Pareto distribution, we can specify `alpha` to adjust how heavy-tailed it is. Here is an example:

```yaml
speed_simulation: true
simulation_distribution: pareto
    distribution: pareto
    alpha: 1
```
````
`````

````{admonition} sleep_simulation
Should clients really go to sleep (`false`), or should we just simulate the sleep times (`true`)? The default is `false`.

Simulating the sleep times — rather than letting clients go to sleep and measure the actual local training times including the sleep times — will be helpful to increase the speed of running the experiments, and to improve reproducibility, since every time the experiments run, the average training time will remain the same, and specified using the `avg_training_time` setting below.

```{admonition} **avg_training_time**
If we are simulating client training times, what is the average training time? When we are simulating the sleep times rather than letting clients go to sleep, we will not be able to use the measured wall-clock time for local training. As a result, we need to specify this value in lieu of the measured training time.
```
````

```{admonition} outbound_processors
A list of processors for the client to apply on the payload before sending it out to the server. Multiple processors are permitted.
