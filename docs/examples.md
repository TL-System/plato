# Examples

In `examples/`, we included a wide variety of examples that showcased how third-party deep learning frameworks, such as [Catalyst](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/), can be used, and how a collection of federated learning algorithms in the research literature can be implemented using Plato by customizing the `client`, `server`, `algorithm`, and `trainer`. We also included detailed tutorials on how Plato can be run on Google Colab. Here is a list of the examples we included.

#### Support for Third-Party Frameworks 

````{admonition} **Catalyst**
Plato supports the use of third-party frameworks for its training loops. This example shows how [Catalyst](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/) can be used with Plato for local training and testing on the clients. This example uses a very simple PyTorch model and the MNIST dataset to show how the model, the training and validation datasets, as well as the training and testing loops can be quickly customized in Plato.

#### Server Aggregation Algorithms

````{admonition} **FedAtt**
FedAtt is a server aggregation algorithm, where client updates were aggregated using a layer-wise attention-based mechanism that considered the similarity between the server and client models.  The objective was to improve the accuracy or perplexity of the trained model with the same number of communication rounds. In its implementation in `examples/fedatt/fedatt_algorithm.py`, the PyTorch implementation of FedAtt overrides `aggregate_weights()` to implement FedAtt as a custom server aggregation algorithm.

```shell
python examples/server_aggregation/fedatt/fedatt.py -c examples/server_aggregation/fedatt/fedatt_FashionMNIST_lenet5.yml
```

````{admonition} **FedAdp**
FedAdp is another server aggregation algorithm, which exploited the implicit connection between data distribution on a client and the contribution from that client to the global model, measured at the server by inferring gradient information of participating clients. In its implementation in `examples/fedadp/fedadp_server.py`, a framework-agnostic implementation of FedAdp overrides `aggregate_deltas()` to implement FedAdp as a custom server aggregation algorithm.

#### Secure Aggregation with Homomorphic Encryption

````{admonition} **MaskCrypt**
MaskCrypt is a secure federated learning system based on homomorphic encryption. Instead of encrypting all the model updates, MaskCrypt encrypts only part of them to balance the tradeoff between security and efficiency. In this example, clients only select 5% of the model updates to encrypt during the learning process. The number of encrypted weights is determined by `encrypt_ratio`, which can be adjusted in the configuration file. A random mask will be adopted if `random_mask` is set to true.

```shell
python examples/secure_aggregation/maskcrypt/maskcrypt.py -c examples/secure_aggregation/maskcrypt/maskcrypt_MNIST_lenet5.yml
```
````

#### Asynchronous Federated Learning Algorithms

````{admonition} **FedAsync**
FedAsync is one of the first algorithms proposed in the literature towards operating federated learning training sessions in *asynchronous* mode, which Plato supports natively. It advocated aggregating aggressively whenever only *one* client reported its local updates to the server.

In its implementation, FedAsync's server subclasses from the `FedAvg` server and overrides its `configure()` and `aggregate_weights()` functions. In `configure()`, it needs to add some custom features (of obtaining a mixing hyperparameter for later use in the aggregation process), and calls `super().configure()` first, similar to its `__init__()` function calling `super().__init__()`. When it overrides `aggregate_weights()`, however, it supplied a completely custom implementation of this function.

```shell
python examples/async/fedasync/fedasync.py -c examples/async/fedasync/fedasync_MNIST_lenet5.yml
python examples/async/fedasync/fedasync.py -c examples/async/fedasync/fedasync_CIFAR10_resnet18.yml
```

```
````

````{admonition} **Port**
Port is one of the federated learning training sessions in *asynchronous* mode. The server will aggregate when it receives a minimum number of clients' updates, which can be tuned with 'minimum_clients_aggregated'. The 'staleness_bound' is also a common parameter in asynchronous FL, which limit the staleness of all clients' updates. 'request_update' is a special design in Port, to force clients report their updates and shut down the training process if their too slow. 'similarity_weight' and 'staleness_weight' are two hyper-parameters in Port, tuning the weights of them when the server do aggregation. 'max_sleep_time', 'sleep_simulation', 'avg_training_time' and 'simulation_distribution' are also important to define the arrival clients in Port.

#### Federated Unlearning

````{admonition} **Federated Unlearning**
Federated unlearning is a concept proposed in the recent research literature that uses an unlearning algorithm, such as retraining from scratch, to guarantee that a client is able to remove all the effects of its local private data samples from the trained model.  In its implementation in `examples/unlearning/fedunlearning/fedunlearning_server.py` and `examples/unlearning/fedunlearning/fedunlearning_client.py`, a framework-agnostic implementation of federated unlearning overrides several methods in the client and server APIs, such as the server's `aggregate_deltas()` to implement federated unlearning.

```shell
python examples/unlearning/fedunlearning/fedunlearning.py -c examples/unlearning/fedunlearning/fedunlearning_adahessian_MNIST_lenet5.yml

```{note}
If the AdaHessian optimizer is used as in the example configuration file, it will reflect what the following paper proposed:

```
````

````{admonition} **Knot**
Knot is implemented in `examples/unlearning`, which clusters the clients, and the server aggregation is carried out within each cluster only. Knot is designed under **asynchronous** mode, and unlearned by retraining from scratch in cluster. The global model will be aggregated at the end of the retraining process. Knot supports a wide range of tasks, including image classification and language tasks.

````{admonition} **Gradient leakage attacks and defenses**
Gradient leakage attacks and their defenses have been extensively studied in the research literature on federated learning.  In `examples/gradient_leakage_attacks/`, several attacks, including `DLG`, `iDLG`, and `csDLG`, have been implemented, as well as several defense mechanisms, including `Soteria`, `GradDefense`, `Differential Privacy`, `Gradient Compression`, and `Outpost`.

#### Algorithms with Customized Client Training Loops

````{admonition} **SCAFFOLD**
SCAFFOLD is a synchronous federated learning algorithm that performs server aggregation with control variates to better handle statistical heterogeneity. It has been quite widely cited and compared with in the federated learning literature. In this example, two processors, called `ExtractControlVariatesProcessor` and `SendControlVariateProcessor`, have been introduced to the client using a callback class, called `ScaffoldCallback`. They are used for sending control variates between the clients and the server. Each client also tries to maintain its own control variates for local optimization using files.

````{admonition} **FedTI**
FedTI is to perform textual inversion under federated learning, which we can simply refer
to as federated textual inversion. This approach treats the learnable pseudo-word embedding as the global model, and thus allows clients to train cooperatively using the FL paradigm.

#### Client Selection Algorithms

````{admonition} **Active Federated Learning**
Active Federated Learning is a client selection algorithm, where clients were selected not uniformly at random in each round, but with a probability conditioned on the current model and the data on the client to maximize training efficiency. The objective was to reduce the number of required training iterations while maintaining the same model accuracy. In its implementation in `examples/afl/afl_server.py`, the server overrides `choose_clients()` to implement a custom client selection algorithm, and overrides `weights_aggregated()` to extract additional information from client reports.

````

````{admonition} **Pisces**
Pisces is an asynchronous federated learning algorithm that performs biased client selection based on overall utilities and weighted server aggregation based on staleness. In this example, a client running the Pisces algorithm calculates its statistical utility and report it together with model updates to Pisces server. The server then evaluates the overall utility for each client based on the reported statistical utility and client staleness, and selects clients for the next communication round. The algorithm also attempts to detect outliers via DBSCAN for better robustness.

````{admonition} **Oort**
Oort is a federated learning algorithm that performs biased client selection based on both statistical utility and system utility. Originally, Oort is proposed for synchronous federated learning. In this example, it was adapted to support both synchronous and asynchronous federated learning. Notably, the Oort server maintains a blacklist for clients that have been selected too many times (10 by default). If `per_round` / `total_clients` is large, e.g. 2/5, the Oort server may not work correctly because most clients are in the blacklist and there will not be a sufficient number of clients that can be selected.

#### Split Learning Algorithms

````{admonition} **Split Learning**
Split learning aims to collaboratively train deep learning models with the server performing a portion of the training process. In split learning, each training iteration is separated into two phases: the clients first send extracted features at a specific cut layer to the server, and then the server continues the forward pass and computes gradients, which will be sent back to the clients to complete the backward pass of the training. Unlike federated learning, split learning clients sequentially interact with the server, and the global model is synchronized implicitly through the model on the server side, which is shared and updated by all clients.

python ./run -c configs/CIFAR10/split_learning_resnet18.yml

````{admonition} **Split Learning for Training ControlNet**
ControlNet is a conditional image generation model that only finetunes the control network without updating parameters in the large diffusion model. It has a more complicated structure than the usual deep learning model. Hence, to train a ControlNet with split learning, the control network and a part of the diffusion model are on the clients and the remaining part of the diffusion model is on the server. The forwarding and backwarding processes are specifically designed according to the inputs and training targets of the image generation based on diffusion models.

#### Algorithms based on Neural Architecture Search and Model Search

````{admonition} **FedRLNAS**
FedRLNAS is an algorithm designed to conduct Federated Neural Architecture Search without sending the entire supernet to the clients. Instead, clients still perform conventional model training as in Federated Averaging, and the server will search for the best model architecture.

````{admonition} **FedTP**
FedTP is proposed to improve personalized federated learning with transformer structured models. For each client, the attention maps in the transformer block are generated and updated by a hypernet working on the server, instead of being updated by average aggregation. The core part is in ```fedtp_server```: ```customize_server_payload``` reloads the weights of attention maps with attention generated by hypernet before sending the models to clients and ```aggregate_weights``` updates the hypernet besides doing averaging aggregation of other parts of the model. 

```shell

````{admonition} **HeteroFL**
HeteroFL is an algorithm aimed at solving heterogeneous computing resources requirements on different federated learning clients. They use five different complexities to compress the channel width of the model. In the implementation, we need to modify the model to implement those five complexities and scale modules. We provide examples of ```ResNet``` family and ```MobileNetV3``` family here. The core operations of assigning different complexities to the clients and aggregate models of complexities are in function ```get_local_parameters``` and ```aggregation``` respectively, in ```heterofl_algorithm.py```.

````{admonition} **FedRolex**
FedRolex argues the statistical method of pruning channels in HeteroFL will cause unbalanced updates of the model parameters. In this algorithm, they introduce a rolling mechanism to evenly update the parameters of each channel in the system-heterogeneous federated learning. In this implementation, models of ResNet and ViT are supported.

````{admonition} **FjORD**
FjORD, different to FedRolex and HeteroFL, adopted a policy called ordered dropout to randomly select the pruning channels in the system-heterogeneous federated learning. To further improve the performance of aggregating models of different architectures, they further proposed to conduct distillation on each device between bigger sub-networks and smaller subnetworks, if the devices have enough computation abilities.

AnyCostFL is an on-demand system-heterogeneous federated learning method to assign models of different architectures to meet the resource budgets of devices in federated learning. In this algorithm, it adopts the similar policy to assign models of different channel pruning rates as the HeteroFL. But they prune the channel on the basis of the magnitude of the $l_2$ norms of the channels. In this implementation, models of ResNet and ViT are supported.

````{admonition} **Sub-FedAvg**
Sub-FedAvg aims to obtain a personalized model for each client with non-i.i.d. local data. It iteratively prunes the parameters of each client’s local model during its local training, with the objective of removing the commonly shared parameters of local models and keeping the personalized ones. Besides the original version for two-layer federated learning, the version for three-layer federated learning has been implemented as well.

For two-layer federated learning:

```shell
python examples/model_pruning/sub_fedavg/subfedavg.py -c examples/model_pruning/sub_fedavg/subfedavg_MNIST_lenet5.yml
